# VoiceSentinel - Quick Start Guide

This project contains two main systems:
1.  **Call Center Agent (Live/File)**: For businesses to analyze incoming calls (CLI or Twilio).
2.  **Regular User Monitor**: For individuals to detect AI voices during their calls.

## 1. Call Center Agent (Live Mode)
Simulates a call center agent talking to a user. It asks questions (OTP, Name, DOB), records answers via microphone, and analyzes risk.

*   **Command**:
    ```bash
    venv/bin/python main_simulation.py
    ```
    *(Follow the on-screen prompts. Speak into your microphone.)*

## 2. Call Center Agent (File Mode)
Analyze a pre-recorded audio file directly (skipping the Q&A). Useful for bulk processing or testing.

*   **Command**:
    ```bash
    venv/bin/python main_simulation.py --audio-input fraud_ai.wav
    ```
    *(Replace `fraud_ai.wav` with any file path).*

## 3. Regular User Monitor (Day-to-Day Use)
A desktop tool that listens to your system audio (speakers) during a call (Zoom, Skype, Phone) and notifies you if the voice is AI.

*   **Command**:
    ```bash
    venv/bin/python regular_user/monitor.py
    ```
    *   **Option 1**: Start Monitoring (Records 10 seconds of what you hear).
    *   **Option 2**: Analyze a specific file.

## 4. Twilio Setup (Cloud Deployment)
To deploy the real-time phone agent:
1.  Deploy to Render (using `Procfile`).
2.  Set Twilio Webhook to `https://your-app.onrender.com/voice`.

## Test Data
*   **Account 12345**: High Risk History (Simulated fraud patterns).
*   **Account 99999**: Low Risk History (Simulated clean user).
